          "[If] reasonable people could differ on whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor based on the evidence in the case, the question is not for a court to decide; it must go to the jury. This is true even if no significant dispute exists about the underlying facts, because the act of weighing and applying numerous intertwined factors, based on particular facts, is itself generally the job of the <em>jury.Cotter v. Lyft, Inc., 60 F. Supp. 3d 1067, 1076-77 (N.D. Cal. 2015)</em>. The court may grant summary judgment only if it concludes that only a single inference and conclusion may be drawn from all the facts. Id. However, that does not mean that the court cannot determine employment status as a matter of law unless all the factors in this multi-factor test must point in the same direction. Id. at 1077."

The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Archbishop, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that Mendoza failed to establish that a full-time position was available and, therefore, that a discriminatory reason more likely than not motivated the employer.Employee Could Proceed With Misclassification Claim, Though Wrongful Termination Claim Was Properly RejectedDavis v. Farmers Ins. Exch., 245 Cal. App. 4th 1302 (2016) William A. Davis brought suit against Farmers, claiming he had been wrongfully classified as an independent contractor rather than an employee and asserting that he had been wrongfully terminated on the basis of his age. The trial court directed a verdict in Farmers\'s favor on the wage claim, and the jury found for Farmers on the wrongful termination claim, having concluded that Farmers would have made the same termination decision for legitimate non-discriminatory reasons – even though the jury agreed with Davis that his age was a "substantial motivating factor" in his termination.'
